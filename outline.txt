This project is divided into multiple independent or semi-independent systems, which control different aspects of the project (video, networking, etc)
These systems are:

Raspberry Pi Gyro [DONE]
    - sends SenseHAT gyroscope data over UDP to the master computer

Gyro Data Recv [DONE]
    - receives SenseHAT gyroscope data over UDP and decodes it into pitch roll and yaw variables

Mouse Movement [TODO]
    - first person games can be played in vr
    - transform pitch and yaw angles into 2d mouse offsets
    - use enigo crate to move the mouse

Record Screen [TODO]
    - record the screen of the master computer to send to the VR display

Video Stream webpage [TODO]
    - package the video stream into a webpage that can be opened on a web browser

Send Video Stream Webpage [TODO]
    - send the webpage over UDP to the phone acting as a vr display
    - the phone has a web browser listening to the port that the video stream will be sent to

Misc Notes

mouse translation maths notes:

Z = yaw
Y = roll (not used)
X = pitch

last_etc = last value

yaw, roll, pitch = ...

pitch *= -1

delta_pitch = pitch - last_pitch
delta_yaw = yaw - last_yaw

last_pitch = pitch
last_yaw = yaw

change_x = delta_pitch * pi * screenl / 180
change_y = delta_yaw * pi * screenw / 180

mouse_x, mouse_y = mouse.position()
mouse.moveTo(mouse_x + change_x, mouse_y + change_y, duration = 0.1)
